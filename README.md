# Fight To Online Life
It's a game project using Unity3D. 
I made this game when Covid was first introduced to our country. That time our online class was started but I never like the online education system. And from this I thought that It'll be more fun if a game can be developed which match the current situation.
It's a simple Unity project. I had given my voice for shooting. In a nutshell, this game is just for fun. And I wish you also like it.
