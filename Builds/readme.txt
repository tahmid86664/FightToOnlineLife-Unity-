I prefer Firefox to open the game

If something wrong in firefox, like, webgl not supporting etc, then follow the steps
1. open firefox
2. in searchbox and type- about:config
3. press accept and continue
4. Use the search box at the top of the list to find the settings listed below.

    webgl.force-enabled - set from false to true 
    layers.acceleration.force-enabled - set from false to true

 You can change the value of these items by double-clicking them. 

It may helps you to run the game.
